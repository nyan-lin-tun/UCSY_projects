				<h2><i><b>Who designed the first camera?</b></i></h2>
					<p>
						The first partially successful photograph of a camera image was made in approximately 1816 by Nicéphore Niépce, using a very small camera of his own making and a piece of paper coated with silver chloride, which darkened where it was exposed to light.

				<h2><b><i>What is the differences between TLRs and SLRs?</i></b></h2>
				<p>
					TLRs are also very quiet and don’t have any vibrations due to the fixed mirror. This results in better quality handheld pictures at low speeds. SLRs are mainly great because when you look through that viewfinder, you’re looking at a near perfect representation of what your final image will look like.

			<h2><b><i>What is camera lens?</i></b></h2>
				<p>
					A camera lens (also known as photographic lens or photographic objective) is an optical lens or assembly of lenses used in conjunction with a camera body and mechanism to make images of objects either on photographic film or on other media capable of storing an image chemically or electronically.<br><br>
				</p><hr />
			<h2><b><i>What is autofocus?</i></b></h2>
				<p>
					Before there was autofocus, there was focus. The camera is a light-tight box that is used to expose a photosensitive surface (film or digital sensor) to light. In order to focus the light onto the surface, most cameras (and your own eyes) use a lens to direct the light.<br><br>
				</p><hr />
			<h2><b><i>How camera works?</i></b></h2>
				<p>
					Digital cameras look very much like ordinary film cameras but they work in a completely different way. When you press the button to take a photograph with a digital camera, an aperture opens at the front of the camera and light streams in through the lens. So far, it's just the same as a film camera<br><br>
